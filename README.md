# 🐶 Tindog Website

A responsive and fun landing page built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, inspired by a “dating app for dogs” concept. This project showcases design, layout, animations, and interactivity — all done from scratch.

## 📌 Overview

Tindog Website is a static web project that mimics a playful, pet-themed version of a dating app. It demonstrates front-end design skills and basic web interactivity using:

- Responsive design
- CSS animations
- Interactive buttons and hover effects

This is a portfolio-worthy project, not a full back-end app, but it effectively shows your HTML/CSS/JS capabilities.
